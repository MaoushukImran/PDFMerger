# PDFMerger
This Python script provides an easy way to merge multiple PDF files from a specified folder into a single output PDF file. It uses the `PyPDF2` library to perform the merging process and `glob` to locate all PDF files in the given directory. This tool is useful for automating the task of combining PDFs without having to manually open each file.
